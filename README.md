# stat501-seismic-poisson-gulf-of-california
This repository contains the code, data workflow, and slides for my **STAT 501 project** on stochastic modeling of seismic events in the **Gulf of California** region.  The main objective is to investigate whether the occurrence of moderate-to-large earthquakes in the region can be modeled as a **stationary Poisson process**.
